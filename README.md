MapGroove
v.01

So this is probably a one-use tool, but just in case.
Basically you enable, put in the url of an xml feed of data,
map the the xml elements to human names, and maps the data
via city/state onto a map, along with a column searchable table.

There is a required plugin because this plugin is developed
for internal use.
