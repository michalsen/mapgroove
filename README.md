MapGroove
v.01

So this is probably a one-use tool, but just in case.
Basically you enable, put in the url of an xml feed of data,
map the the xml elements to human names, and maps the data
via city/state onto a map, along with a column searchable table.

There is some hardcoded goodies hidden in here specifically for
the case-use, so if you use it, be aware, it may take some tweeking
to get it to work for you.
